%%% have to specify the top and bottom boxes before you specify the middle

\subsection*{Condition}
\begin{itemize}
\item Minority languages. Novel speech sounds, agglomerative morphology, large vocabularies but low resources. 
\item Limited training data for speech recognizer (\textasciitilde10 hours).
\item Word Error Rate from 60\% to 80\%.
\item OOV keyword percentage from 10\% to 25\%
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Approaches}
\begin{itemize}
\item Find IV words that are closest in pronunciation to the OOV keywords (using phone confusion matrix). Search for IV proxies
and hypothesize OOV occurances.
\item Use phones, syllables and morphs as subword units for representing OOV words. Perform subword decoding, and search OOV words in subword lattices.
\item Perform subword decoding. Transduce subword lattices to word lattices, and search keywords in transduced word lattices.

\item Syllable transduction is helpful in spotting both IVs and OOVs in KWS. It tends to give a lower false alarm rate.
